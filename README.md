# Home Automation Project

* Download arduino software from official website.
* Clone the directory 'Home' 
* Compile and Upload the required main file with extention (.ino) in Arduino IDE software.
* Check connections twice before powering arduino.
* For any errors, syntax and pinDiagram refer https://www.arduino.cc

KEEP IN MIND :
1) Arduino requires only 5V. (Use proper cable to power up)
2) Make sure that TX RX of Bluetooth module is removed from arduino while uploading any bluetooth module program.
3) GSM might give runtime error ! Be patient (and try calling the sim inside GSM to confirm that sim is rechable)
4) Some RFID module needs 12V make sure that arduino and RFID module is grounded properly.
